<h3 align="center">CS10: Early Detection of Environmental Threats from Satellite Imagery</h3>

---

<p> 
This project tackles Singapore's transboundary haze and wildfire smoke detection challenge using computer vision. We built a compact, high-throughput CNN classifier that distinguishes fire smoke, haze, and normal atmospheric conditions from satellite imagery—addressing a critical gap where visual similarity in RGB images makes manual analysis too slow and costly for real-time monitoring.​

Our solution enables early detection that helps citizens prepare (N95 masks, air purifiers), supports healthcare capacity planning during haze episodes, identifies active fire sources before they spread, and allows aviation authorities to mitigate visibility risks. The model is optimized for weighted F1-score, throughput (images/second), and minimal model size, with explainability features to build trust with public safety operators.​

Built by a team of polytechnic students specializing in AI, data engineering, cybersecurity, and IT for the HacX! Hack for Public Safety 2025, organized by HTX and Microsoft in collaboration with SUTD.​

## 🧐 Problem Statement <a name = "problem_statement"></a>

- Current State: Haze in Singapore is primarily caused by transboundary air pollution from 
forest fires and exacerbated by seasonal weather pattern. Early satellite
based detection of such environmental threats plays a vital role in 
monitoring, forecasting, and mitigating its effects. However, different 
weather conditions may be difficult to distinguish from the top-down 
view.
 
- Aim: Develop a classification model that leverages computer vision to 
accurately differentiate haze and smoke threats from normal clouds and 
other environmental elements in satellite images.

## 💡 Idea / Solution <a name = "idea"></a>

This section is used to describe potential solutions.

Once the ideal, reality, and consequences sections have been
completed, and understood, it becomes easier to provide a solution for solving the problem.

## ⛓️ Dependencies / Limitations <a name = "limitations"></a>

- What are the dependencies of your project?
- Describe each limitation in detailed but concise terms
- Explain why each limitation exists
- Provide the reasons why each limitation could not be overcome using the method(s) chosen to acquire.
- Assess the impact of each limitation in relation to the overall findings and conclusions of your project, and if
  appropriate, describe how these limitations could point to the need for further research.

## 🚀 Future Scope <a name = "future_scope"></a>
